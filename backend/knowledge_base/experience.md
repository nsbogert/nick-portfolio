Experience

### Career Summary & Role Classification
Nick's career spans ~20 years across Intel and Amazon, but his roles fall into distinct categories:

- **Engineering Management (6 years, 2020–2026):** Nick transitioned into engineering management in 2018 via the "Save or Upgrade" project. His formal EM roles are Sr. Manager of Software Engineering (2020–2023), Head of 3D Synthetic Spaces (2023–2025), and Engineering Manager of Weblab (2025–2026). These roles involved hiring, coaching, performance management, sprint planning, architecture decisions, and leading teams of 6–20 engineers.
- **Technical Product Management (4 years, 2014–2017, plus dual-role overlap 2018–2020):** Senior Technical Product Manager on Amazon Part Finder. Nick also held a hybrid PM/EM role on Save or Upgrade (2018–2020) where he wrote the PRFAQ and led both product and engineering.
- **Operations & Supply Chain (7 years, 2006–2013):** Intel (Operations Manager, Industrial Engineer, Supply Chain Analyst) and Amazon (Business Capacity Analyst, Instock Manager). These are NOT engineering management roles — they are operations, supply chain, and business analytics roles.
- **Founder (2026–present):** Guardrail WA. Technical founder doing architecture, product, and business development.

**Key distinction:** When asked "how many years of engineering management experience," the answer is approximately **6 years** (2020–2026). Nick's total career is ~20 years, but the earlier roles at Intel and early Amazon were operations/supply chain/product — not software engineering management.

### Amazon (2011 – 2026)
- **Engineering Manager, Weblab (Mar 2025 – 2026):** [Role Type: Engineering Management]
  - **Scale:** Owned Amazon’s experimentation platform analyzing 50k+ experiments/year, 7T triggers/day, and guiding decisions worth $10Bs for 10k+ MAUs.
  - **Analysis Engine Replacement:** Rescued a 3-year stagnant backend project by unifying three conflicting roadmaps into a single vision, and clearly defined an MVP. Launched the first metric in 1 month (Month 1 of tenure) and established a biweekly incremental delivery cadence. Resulted in a **100x analysis job speed-up**, 50% ops reduction, and improved accuracy (+15%).
  - **Analysis Tech Stack:** Spark, EMR, Python, Apache Airflow, AWS. 
  - **Microservice Migration (App Team):** Led a high-velocity migration from a legacy Java/Spring on-prem monolith ('Horizonte') to an AWS-hosted Node.js microservice architecture. By "clearing the calendar" and assigning dedicated microservice ownership per engineer, completed a 4-year lagging project in 2 months. 
  - **Operational Impact:** Eliminated deprecation risk, reduced compute costs by 60%, and freed up 0.5 HC in operational burden.
  - **AI Integration & Roadmap:** Shipped weekly improvements including "Weblab Bar Raiser AI" (Claude + RAG + **MCP**) to automate experiment writeups and coaching, reducing post-processing time by ~60%. Established a "High Priority Only" tenet to shunting low-leverage work.
- **Head of 3D Synthetic Spaces (July 2023 – Mar 2025):** [Role Type: Engineering Management]
  - **Technical Stack:** Led development of a WebGL-based frontend (Babylon.js) using state-machine architecture and custom rasterization pipelines to blend high-res cube maps over low-poly geometry.
  - **Innovation (Matisse & Hokusai):** Prototyped synthetic store generation in Unreal Engine, reducing store creation costs from $200k to $10k and refresh costs to $1k.
  - **Strategic Pivot:** Pivoted team from scaling initiatives to delivering a high-polish 2024 Holiday Flagship store. Managed rapid delivery of bespoke JS animations, music, and interactive features while tracking tech debt for a 3-month post-launch "clawback" phase.
  - **High-Stakes Ops:** Orchestrated a holiday hot-swap of iPad Pro 3D models to meet Apple's branding requirements without downtime.
- **Sr. Manager, Software Engineering (July 2020 – July 2023):** [Role Type: Engineering Management]
  - **Single Threaded Leader:** Founded the Home Improvement Tech organization (3 teams, 20 Engineers). Grew team ~3x from 6 engineers & financial impact from $0 to >$1B/yr.
  - **Paint & Flooring Finders:** Led computer vision tools using semantic segmentation and shading math.
  - Founded and led internal centers of excellence for Privacy and Experimentation.
  - **Origin of Dual Role:** Wrote a PRFAQ proposing a recommendation widget to explore customer value perception and build trust. Stepped in to lead both Product and Engineering when an EM could not be found.
  - **Rapid Prototyping & UX:** Generated 5 layouts, conducting "hallway" and street testing followed by usertesting.com validation.
  - **Speed to Market:** Postponed complex algorithmic modeling in favor of a manual "product research + intuition" model for the pilot (TVs), successfully scaling this approach to 10 additional categories.
  - **High-Judgment Sunset:** After allocating 6 months to generalize the model using regression, random forest, and SVMs without achieving consistent customer results, made the difficult call to shelve the project. Recognized that leadership required "scale or nothing" and the current tech stack was not yet viable (a problem modern AI would likely solve).
- **Senior Technical Product Manager, Amazon Part Finder (2014 – 2017):** [Role Type: Technical Product Management]
  - **Incremental Revenue:** Launched a compatibility widget across 15 categories and 6 countries, driving >$1B in annualized incremental revenue and 10s of millions in profit.
  - **Program Scaling:** Built and scaled a program of 50+ data professionals to collect and process data from 700+ sources across 38 categories, saving $1.8M/year (72% cost reduction).
  - **Technical Infrastructure:** Developed an AWS-based BI system processing >1B records daily and led the creation of a crowd-sourced compatibility portal for internal users and vendors.
  - **Fitment Modeling:** Personally created a large portion of the production data pipeline and fitment data model (AWS S3, Redshift, Python, SQL, shell scripting).
- **Instock Manager, Physical Media (2013 – 2014):** [Role Type: Operations / Supply Chain]
  - **Inventory Management:** Managed $290M in accounts, reducing PLT from 8 to 3.5 days and cutting inventory by $20M.
  - **Forecasting Systems:** Built a forecasting system that learned from past promotions, saving 55 hours/week in manual reporting and forecasting while reducing carrying costs by $250k/year.
  - **ML Partnership:** Partnered with the internal ML platform team to automate sales/receipts forecasting at the vendor level with product-level overrides.
- **Business Capacity Analyst (2011 – 2013):** [Role Type: Operations / Business Analytics]
  - **Network Strategy:** Published 18- and 36-month capacity plans for all North American Fulfillment Centers, covering topology, labor, and capital allocation.

  - **Peak Readiness:** Created automated dashboards for peak-season preparation to maximize capital utilization while meeting customer promises.

### Intel Corporation (2006 – 2011)
- **Senior Supply Chain Analyst:** [Role Type: Operations / Supply Chain]
  - **Leadership:** Led monthly supply chain leadership meetings to review global transportation trends and discuss new optimization ideas.
  - **Cost Savings:** Wrote product specs and partnered with tech teams to implement optimization projects saving an estimated $25M/year.

  - **Kaizen & Layout Optimization:** Facilitated 30+ Kaizen events. Used spaghetti diagrams and ergonomic modeling to optimize workstation and inventory placement, reducing technician travel by 10,000 miles per year and saving 3M keystrokes and $10M in materials cost avoidance annually.
  - **$45M Cost Avoidance:** Engineered reporting tools and rate models to generate capacity and capital forecasts, avoiding significant capital expenditure during factory expansion.

### Professional Insights & Hiring Profile
