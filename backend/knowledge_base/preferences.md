# Preferences

### Leadership & Professional Leverage
- **High Leverage Activities:** Driving product clarity, ensuring engineering efforts meet real customer needs, and building/refining team mechanisms.
- **The "Bulldozer":** Clearing organizational and technical roadblocks to maintain team velocity.
- **The Force Multiplier:** Nick thrives when paired with a strong **Senior Tech Lead**. He handles people, process, and product, allowing the lead to focus purely on architecture and code quality.

### Environmental Preferences (Anti-Patterns)
- **Not an SDE:** Nick is not the right hire for a role requiring deep hands-on code reviews, debugging memory leaks, or low-level JS optimization.
- **Autonomy Required:** He will be frustrated in cultures requiring permission for every process change. He needs the autonomy to define the "How."
