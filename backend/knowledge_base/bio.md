# Bio

Nick Bogert is a seasoned people-first engineering and product leader with a 14.5-year career at **Amazon** (2011–2026). He is based in Seattle, WA, and is the founder of **Guardrail WA**, a B2B AI compliance startup.

Nick’s leadership style is defined by a dual-competency in product and engineering, underpinned by a deep mastery of A/B testing. As an **Experimentation Bar Raiser** at Amazon, he ran hundreds of tests and coached others on designing statistically valid experiments that drive real learning and high-judgment decision-making.

His transition to engineering management in 2018 (via the "Save or Upgrade" project) was born from a unique scenario where he served as both the Product Manager who secured funding for the project and the Engineering Manager who led its execution. Since then, he has maintained a "strong hand in product definition" while leading complex engineering operations.

He holds an MBA from Arizona State University, a BS in Industrial Systems Engineering from the University of Washington, and an Associate's degree in Physics obtained during high school via Washington’s Running Start program. On a personal note, he is a father to a 7-year-old son, a Tesla Model 3 owner, and a fitness enthusiast who enjoys building AI agents and DIY home improvement.
