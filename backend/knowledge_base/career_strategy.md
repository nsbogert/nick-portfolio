# Career Strategy

This file tracks the overarching narrative, target roles, and market positioning for Nick Bogert.

## The Narrative: "The Product-Minded Engineering Leader"
Nick is a leader who was forged by the need to bridge the gap between Product and Engineering. His value prop is: **"I build the right product, and I build the team that delivers it efficiently."**

## Why Hire Nick?
- **Industrial Engineer Background:** Views teams as systems and optimizes for velocity.
- **Talent Engine:** Proven ability to grow careers and maintain low attrition via structured mentorship systems.
- **AI Forward:** Aggressively dogfooding the future of coding (ClaudeCode); believes the SDE role is shifting from "syntax writer" to "system architect."

## When NOT to Hire Nick?
- **Hands-on SDE Manager:** If the role requires the manager to be the primary code reviewer or low-level debugger.
- **Low Trust / Micromanagement:** If the culture manages by "hours" rather than "outcomes."

## Target Positions
- **Head of Engineering / VP of Engineering:** For mid-sized startups or scale-ups needing operational maturity.
- **Head of Product / Product Lead:** For technical products where deep systems understanding is a moat (e.g., AI infrastructure).
- **Founder / CEO:** Building Guardrail WA into a sustainable B2B CaaS business.

## Target Industries
1. **AI Infrastructure & Compliance:** Leveraging the Guardrail WA research.
2. **Retail & Immersive Tech:** Leveraging 3DS3 and Paint/Flooring Finder experience.
3. **Experimentation & Analytics:** Leveraging Weblab and A/B testing expertise.

## Market Positioning
- **The "Amazon Veteran" for Startups:** Bringing Big Tech scale and "Bias for Action" to scrappy environments.
- **The "Geographic Specialist":** Deep expertise in Pacific Northwest regulatory landscapes.
