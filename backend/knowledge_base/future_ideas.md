## 1. AI-Powered Interactive Portfolio / Resume
**Goal:** Create a personal website that serves as both a portfolio and a demonstration of AI proficiency.

- **Features:**
  - RAG-based chat interface using these markdown files as the source of truth.
  - "Show your work" sections for projects like Paint Finder and Guardrail WA.
  - Ability to answer "Why is Nick a fit for [X] role?" by analyzing the job description against this context.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js, Vercel, OpenAI/Claude API, Vector Database (Pinecone/Supabase).

## 2. Guardrail WA MVP
- (Detailed in `guardrail_wa.md`) - Focus on the first 3 paying customers in the Seattle legal/tech space.

## 3. Fitness "Insight" Engine
