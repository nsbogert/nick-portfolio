# Personal Leadership Principles

These principles define Nick Bogert’s approach to leading teams, building products, and optimizing systems.

## 1. Bias for Action
- Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
- *Context:* This is a core Amazon principle that remains a cornerstone of Nick's startup and leadership mindset.

## 2. People-First Optimization (Talent Developer)
- Nick doesn't just manage people; he helps them manage and grow their careers. 
- **Mechanisms for Growth:** At Amazon, he maintained 3-4 external mentees and built systems like a **Career Advice Wiki** and structured **Mentorship Pairings**.
- **Results:** This approach leads to high loyalty, low attrition, and the maintenance of institutional knowledge.

## 3. Teams as Systems (The Industrial Engineer Mindset)
- Nick views engineering teams as systems to be optimized for velocity and impact.
- **The Bulldozer:** He defines his role as keeping the team pointed in the right direction and acting as a "bulldozer" to clear any roadblocks in their path.

## 4. Product Clarity as Leverage (Building the *Right* Thing)
- Nick protects his team from "feature factories" by using SQL and data analysis to ensure the work aligns with business strategy.
- He bridges the gap between Product and Engineering by helping the team understand "The Why" behind every ticket.

## 5. Outcome-Based Management
- Nick manages by outcomes, not hours. He operates best in high-trust, high-accountability environments where he has the autonomy to define *how* problems are solved.

## 5. Radical Transparency & Straightforwardness
- Acknowledging the situation—even when difficult—builds trust and focus.
- *Evidence:* Used radical transparency to maintain morale during factory shutdowns and project sunsets.

## 6. Continuous Learning & Hands-on Curiosity
- Leaders should stay curious about new technologies (AI, Vector DBs, Computer Vision) even if their primary leverage is strategic.
- Nick actively upskills via Datacamp, ClaudeCode, and hands-on "DIY" projects.
